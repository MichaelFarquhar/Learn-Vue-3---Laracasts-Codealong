# Learn Vue 3 - Laracasts

This repository contains projects that I created while following the [Learn Vue 3: Step by Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-3-step-by-step/) course on Laracasts.

The directories are split into groups of lessons, of which new content was learned and a project was created. After watching these groups of lessons, I then attempted to recreate the project from memory.

`/L1-L3` - Lessons 1-7. Learned the aboslute basics of Vue attributes and syntax. Created a barebones todo list.

`/L4-L7` - Lessons 4-7. Learned about Vue components and props. Recreated the previous project using components.

`/L8-L9` - Lessons 8-9. Expanding upon the previous project, learning how to handle form submissions and use Vue events.

`/L13` - Lessons 13-. Using json-server to create a fake api to fetch data into the todo list project. Json-server can be run through the following: `npx json-server db.json -p 3001`
